> Welcome to the Mem0 quickstart guide. This guide will help you get up and running with Mem0 in no time.

## Installation

To install Mem0, you can use pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install mem0ai
```

## Basic Usage

### Initialize Mem0

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic">
```python
from mem0 import Memory
m = Memory()
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Advanced">
If you want to run Mem0 in production, initialize using the following method:

Run Qdrant first:

```bash
docker pull qdrant/qdrant

docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
    qdrant/qdrant
```

Then, instantiate memory with qdrant server:

```python
from mem0 import Memory

config = {
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "qdrant",
        "config": {
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 6333,
        }
    },
}

m = Memory.from_config(config)
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Store a Memory

```python
# For a user
result = m.add("Likes to play cricket on weekends", user_id="alice", metadata={"category": "hobbies"})
print(result)
```

Output:
```python
[
  {
    'id': 'm1',
    'event': 'add',
    'data': 'Likes to play cricket on weekends'
  }
]
```

### Retrieve Memories

```python
# Get all memories
all_memories = m.get_all()
print(all_memories)
```

Output:

```python
[
  {
    'id': 'm1',
    'text': 'Likes to play cricket on weekends',
    'metadata': {
      'data': 'Likes to play cricket on weekends',
      'category': 'hobbies'
    }
  },
  # ... other memories ...
]
```

```python
# Get a single memory by ID
specific_memory = m.get("m1")
print(specific_memory)
```

Output:
```python
{
  'id': 'm1',
  'text': 'Likes to play cricket on weekends',
  'metadata': {
    'data': 'Likes to play cricket on weekends',
    'category': 'hobbies'
  }
}
```

### Search Memories

```python
related_memories = m.search(query="What are Alice's hobbies?", user_id="alice")
print(related_memories)
```

Output:

```python
[
  {
    'id': 'm1',
    'text': 'Likes to play cricket on weekends',
    'metadata': {
      'data': 'Likes to play cricket on weekends',
      'category': 'hobbies'
    },
    'score': 0.85  # Similarity score
  },
  # ... other related memories ...
]
```

### Update a Memory

```python
result = m.update(memory_id="m1", data="Likes to play tennis on weekends")
print(result)
```

Output:

```python
{
  'id': 'm1',
  'event': 'update',
  'data': 'Likes to play tennis on weekends'
}
```

### Memory History

```python
history = m.history(memory_id="m1")
print(history)
```
Output:
```python
[
  {
    'id': 'h1',
    'memory_id': 'm1',
    'prev_value': None,
    'new_value': 'Likes to play cricket on weekends',
    'event': 'add',
    'timestamp': '2024-07-14 10:00:54.466687',
    'is_deleted': 0
  },
  {
    'id': 'h2',
    'memory_id': 'm1',
    'prev_value': 'Likes to play cricket on weekends',
    'new_value': 'Likes to play tennis on weekends',
    'event': 'update',
    'timestamp': '2024-07-14 10:15:17.230943',
    'is_deleted': 0
  }
]
```

### Delete Memory

```python
m.delete(memory_id="m1") # Delete a memory

m.delete_all(user_id="alice") # Delete all memories
```

### Reset Memory

```python
m.reset() # Reset all memories
```

## Chat Completion

Mem0 can be easily integrate into chat applications to enhance conversational agents with structured memory. Mem0's APIs are designed to be compatible with OpenAI's, with the goal of making it easy to leverage Mem0 in applications you may have already built.

If you have a `Mem0 API key`, you can use it to initialize the client. Alternatively, you can initialize Mem0 without an API key if you're using it locally.

Mem0 supports several language models (LLMs) through integration with various [providers](https://litellm.vercel.app/docs/providers).

## Use Mem0 Platform

```python
from mem0 import Mem0

client = Mem0(api_key="m0-xxx")

# First interaction: Storing user preferences
messages = [
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "I love indian food but I cannot eat pizza since allergic to cheese."
  },
]
user_id = "deshraj"
chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(messages=messages, model="gpt-4o-mini", user_id=user_id)
# Memory saved after this will look like: "Loves Indian food. Allergic to cheese and cannot eat pizza."

# Second interaction: Leveraging stored memory
messages = [
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Suggest restaurants in San Francisco to eat.",
  }
]

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(messages=messages, model="gpt-4o-mini", user_id=user_id)
print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
# Answer: You might enjoy Indian restaurants in San Francisco, such as Amber India, Dosa, or Curry Up Now, which offer delicious options without cheese.
```

In this example, you can see how the second response is tailored based on the information provided in the first interaction. Mem0 remembers the user's preference for Indian food and their cheese allergy, using this information to provide more relevant and personalized restaurant suggestions in San Francisco.

### Use Mem0 OSS

```python
config = {
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "qdrant",
        "config": {
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 6333,
        }
    },
}

client = Mem0(config=config)

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What's the capital of France?",
        }
    ],
    model="gpt-4o",
)
```
